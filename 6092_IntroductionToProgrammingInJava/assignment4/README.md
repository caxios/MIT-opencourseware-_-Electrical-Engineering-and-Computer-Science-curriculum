## Simple Note

static method : Method that is applied to the class. So if there is class A, and this class has instance a,a`,a``... when static method is used, then all these instances get affected by the method.

instance method : Method that is applied to the instance of a class. If 'a' is instsance of the class A, then instance method applied to that individual 'a' not all other instances(e.g. a`, a``).

static variable, instance variable share same concepts as static method and instance method.
